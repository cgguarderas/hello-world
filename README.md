learning code biologyst


Hi everyone my name is CARLOS GUARDERAS.
im from Quito, ECUADOR

I just got into coding this summer because of the SCBI - SMITHSONIAN CONSERVATION BIOLOGICAL INSTITUTE, where i took a course to understand animal population density and occupancy.



im really looking forward to start a couple of projects which are currently running in ECUADOR
GA
1. Removing and monitoring the #FeralGalaposCats and #FeralGalapagosDogs, on the GALAPAGOS ISLANDS, SAN CRISTOBAL ISLAND
2. Analizing current cammera trap data from the ChocÃ³ Region of Ecuador.

> i'll be really gratefull to anyone who is willing to participate in these future goals to achieve better conservation plans in those areas

thanks again,

Greetings from the center of the world,
