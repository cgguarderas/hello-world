Hi everyone my name is CARLOS GUARDERAS.
im from Quito, ECUADOR

I just got into coding this summer because of Chris Sutherland, et al. to understand animal populations.

im really looking forward to start a couple of projects which are currently running in ECUADOR
GA
1. Removing and monitoring the #FeralGalaposCats and #FeralGalapagosDogs, on the GALAPAGOS ISLANDS, SAN CRISTOBAL ISLAND
2. Analizing current cammera data from the Choc√≥ Region of Ecuador.
